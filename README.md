## Introduction

This one-week Blended Intensive Program (BIP) seminar brings together students from four partner universities to examine how legal narratives are constructed, contested, and preserved in historical court records. Focusing on the Salem witchcraft trials as a central case study, the seminar combines historical interpretation with hands-on training in digital humanities tools to provide participants with both theoretical insight and practical experience.
Participants will work with digitized court records from the Salem trials to investigate how accusations, testimonies, and verdicts were embedded in the cultural, political, and social tensions of the time. Through this focused case study, the program invites students to consider how power was exercised, resisted, and recorded within the legal system, and how historical sources both reveal and obscure the lived experiences of individuals involved.

A key component of the seminar is the introduction to digital humanities methods that enhance and complicate traditional approaches to historical sources. Digital history tools will be introduced as a means to critically interrogate the sources, uncover hidden patterns, and ask new questions about the structures and dynamics of justice.

The intensive phase will take place at the Kadir Has University in Istanbul with an interdisciplinary and international group of students.Collaborating universities include Bielefeld University, Kadir Has University Istanbul, the University of Vienna and the University of Oslo.

### Course Materials
This repository contains the materials and resources for the Digital Training component of the seminar. Various basics will be covered in five sessions, including:
- Introduction to Python programming
- Dealing with GitHub (you're in the middle of it right now, congratulations!) and GitHub Codespaces
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis
- Data visualization techniques
- Basic data analysis and interpretation for historical research

## Why programming for historians?
Programming is a powerful tool for historians. It allows us to automate repetitive tasks, to work with large datasets, and to visualize our data in new ways. Programming can help us to ask new questions and to find new answers. It can also help us to communicate our research to a wider audience. In short:
- **Automation**: Many tasks in the humanities are repetitive and can be automated. This saves time and allows you to focus on the essentials.
- **Data analysis**: The amount of data in the humanities is constantly increasing. With programming, you can analyze and visualize this data.
- **Text analysis**: With programming, you can analyze texts in a way that would be impossible by hand.
- **Web scraping**: With programming, you can extract data from websites and use it for your own purposes.
- **Visualization**: With programming, you can visualize data in a way that would be impossible by hand.

## Why Python?

Python is a programming language that is easy to learn and read. It is widely used in the humanities (among many others) and has a large community. This makes it easy to find help and examples. Its syntax is easy to understand and understandable, as it is relatively close to natural language; and above all, Python is one of the most important languages for applications that could be of interest to historians, for example dealing with texts, data analysis, web-scraping and much more. With Python you have not just one tool in your toolbox, but a whole set of tools that you can use for your individual research.

## Course structure

The aim of the course is to provide you with basic knowledge of the Python programming language. The intention is to give you ideas on how you can continue working with digital methods and take away an initial fear of programming. You should take as much in-depth knowledge as possible that can also be followed up at home and, above all, to bring the advantages of programming for humanities tasks closer.
The workshop is structured as follows: There is a folder for each of the following learning units, which contains the content of the session and is designed to be as interactive as possible. This content is then worked on together and deepened with short inputs. As you are currently in the middle of the first learning unit, let's get started right away!

## Good to know:

### 1. GitHub
GitHub is a platform that has become an integral part of modern collaborative software development, but is now also used by many other teams as a version control tool. In a nutshell, GitHub is a web-based platform that offers version control and collaboration in the development of software projects. GitHub acts as a centralized hub for managing and collaborating on code. It utilizes a version control system called Git, which tracks changes made to code over time. This ensures that multiple contributors can work on a project simultaneously without conflicts, and it allows developers to roll back to previous versions if needed.
In this course, we will use GitHub to share code and resources. You can find a lot of programming projects on GitHub, and you can also share your own projects with others. If you are new to GitHub, you can find a lot of tutorials and guides on the internet. You can also find some useful links in the [resources](#resources) section.

### 2. GitHub Codespaces
GitHub Codespaces is a feature of GitHub that allows you to create a cloud-based development environment directly within GitHub. This means that you can write, run, and debug your code directly in your browser without having to install any software on your local machine. This is especially useful if you are working on a computer that does not have the necessary software installed, or if you want to work on your code from different devices. In this course, we will use GitHub Codespaces to write and run Python code and ensure that everyone has the same system basis. You can find more information about GitHub Codespaces in the [resources](#resources) section.

### 3. Visual Studio Code
The user interface of a Codespace is based on Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a very popular code editor and is used by many developers. It is open source and has a large community, so you can find many extensions and themes for it. It is developed by Microsoft for all systems. It is also very easy to use and has a lot of features that makes it a great choice for programming.

### 4. Jupyter Notebooks
Jupyter Notebooks are a great way to write and run Python code. They allow you to write code in cells and run them individually. This is very useful for testing small pieces of code or for writing code that is not part of a larger program. Jupyter Notebooks are widely used in the data science community and are a great tool for learning Python. You can find more information about Jupyter Notebooks in the [resources](#resources) section. In this course we will work sometimes with Jupyter Notebooks, but mostly we try to train you to work with "normal" Python scripts, so that you can use your knowledge in other environments as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------
## Getting started

To start, all participants must set up a codespace. We will be working with codespaces throughout the course.

3. Click on the Plus-Button to create a new codespace
4. A new window opens in which you can see a Visual Studio Code environment. This is your codespace. You can now start working on the content of the first learning unit in folder "session-1".

## ⚠️ Disclaimer ⚠️

This course is designed for beginners with no prior programming experience. We will cover the basics of Python programming and introduce you to some of the most common libraries used in the humanities. We will also provide you with some resources to help you continue learning on your own. **The most important thing is: do not be afraid to make mistakes, you can't break anything here.** Programming is a skill that takes time to develop, and the best way to learn is by doing. So don't be afraid to experiment and try new things. And also keep in mind that everyone has a different learning pace. So don't worry if you don't understand everything right away. Just keep practicing and most importantly: **have fun**!

## Resources

Of course, this course can only show you the basics of Python programming. It's more of a chance to get started in the world of programming. You are strongly encouraged to continue to engage with these topics after this course, as this world has so much to offer and can make your life as a historian much easier. To help you get started, here is a small collection of further resources.
