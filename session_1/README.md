# Session 1: Introduction to Python programming

In this session, we will learn the very basics of Python. If you understand these concepts, you can build on them and learn more advanced concepts. So take your time to understand them! You will learn about:
- Data types
- Variables
- Operators that work with data types
- Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

## How to work with Python
- **Python Interpreter**: You can run Python code in an interactive environment. You can start the Python interpreter by typing `python3` in your terminal. An interpreter is a special program that reads and executes code. You can type Python code directly into the interpreter and it will execute it immediately. This is a great way to test small pieces of code.
  - Try it out: Open your terminal and type `python3`. You should see the Python interpreter starting. Now you can type `print("Hello, World!")` and press enter. You should see the output `Hello, World!`.
- **Python Script**: You can write Python code in a file and run it with the Python interpreter. This is called a python script. You can create a new file with the extension `.py` and write your Python code in it. You can run the Python script by typing `python filename.py` in your terminal.
  - Try it out: Create a new file with the name `hello.py` and write the following code in it:
    ```python
    print("Hello, World!")
    ```
    Save the file and run it by typing `python3 hello.py` in your terminal. You should see the output `Hello, World!`.
    To create a new file in Visual Studio Code, you can click on the `File` menu and then on `New File`. You can save the file by clicking on the `File` menu and then on `Save As...`.
- In Visual Studio Code, you can run Python code (if you have the Python extension installed) by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + N` or by clicking on the `Run Python File in Terminal` button ▶️ in the top right corner of the editor.
  - Try it out: Open the file `hello.py` in Visual Studio Code and run it by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + N`. You should see the output `Hello, World!`.

## Basic vocabulary

Before we start with the first Python program, we should clarify some basic terms. These are the basic vocabulary of Python:

- **Expression**: An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. Expressions need to be evaluated. In the example above, `number_1 + number_2` is an expression.
- **Value**: A value is one of the basic things a program works with. For example, the strings `"Hello, i am a Python program that adds two numbers."`, `"The first number is: "`, `"The second number is: "`, and `"The sum is: "` are all values.
- **Variable**: A variable is a container for a value. It can be used to store data. In the example above, `number_1` and `number_2` are variables. Variables are written without quotes. Variables are important because they allow you to store and reuse data instead of repeating yourself.
- **Operator**: An operator is a special symbol that represents a simple computation like addition, multiplication, or string concatenation. In the example above, `+` is an operator.
- **Data type**: A data type is a category for values, and every value belongs to exactly one data type. In the example above, the data type of `number_1` and `number_2` is an integer, the data type of the strings is a string.

## Errors

When you write a program, you will make errors. Errors can be of different types. The most common types of errors are:
- **Syntax errors**: These are errors where the parser finds an incorrect statement. It will not execute the code. These are errors you will get when you make a typo or forget to add a closing bracket, for example.
- **Runtime errors**: These are errors that happen when the program is running. These are also called exceptions. These are errors you will get when you try to access a variable that is not defined, for example.
- **Semantic errors**: These are errors in logic. These are errors you will get when you write a program that is syntactically correct and runs, but does not do what you intended it to do.

Errors are normal and they are a part of the learning process. You should not be afraid of making errors. You should read the error messages carefully and try to understand what they are telling you. This is the best way to learn from it. So no worries!


## Variables
You can store values in variables with an **assignment statement**. An assignment statement consists of a variable name, an equal sign (called the assignment operator), and the value to be stored. If you want to store the value `10` in the variable `number_1`, you can do this with the following code:

```python
number_1 = 10
```
Storing a value in a variable is often necessary. For example, you want to program a individual greeting message to your fellow students. You don't want to write every single greeting message by hand. For this, you can create a variable `name` and store the name of the person in it. Then you can use this variable in your greeting message.
You can also overwrite the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it. If you want to store the value `20` in the variable `number_1`, you can do this with the following code:

```python
number_1 = 10
print(number_1) # Output: 10
number_1 = 20
print(number_1) # Output: 20
```

The naming of a variable is very important. You should always choose a name that describes the content of the variable. The name of a variable can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. It must start with a letter or an underscore. It is case-sensitive, so `number_1` and `Number_1` are two different variables.

```python
Number_1 = 10
print(number_1) # Output: 10
number_1 = 20
print(Number_1) # Output: 10
```

You can work with variables as you would with values. You can use them in expressions, and you can pass them to functions. In the example above, we used the variables `number_1` and `number_2` in the expression `number_1 + number_2`.

## Data types

- **Integers**: Integers (ints) are whole numbers. In the example above, `10` and `20` are integers.
- **Floating-point numbers**: Floating-point numbers (floats) are numbers with a decimal point. For example, `1.43` and `10.0` are floats.
- **Strings**: Strings (str) are sequences of characters. In the example above, `"Hello, i am a Python program that adds to numbers."`, `"The first number is: "`, `"The second number is: "`, and `"The sum is: "` are all strings.
- **Booleans**: Booleans (bools) are either `True` or `False`. In the example above, `True` and `False` are booleans.

## Operators


| Operator | Operation                         | Example   | Result |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | --------- | ------ |
| +        | Addition                          | `2 + 2`   | `4`    |
| -        | Substraction                      | `5 - 2`   | `3`    |
| *        | Multiplication                    | `5 * 2`   | `10`   |
| /        | Division                          | `14 / 4`  | `3.5`  |
| //       | Integer division/floored quotient | `14 // 4` | `3`    |
| %        | Modulus                           | `25 % 7`  | `4`    |
| **       | Exponent                          | `2 ** 4`  | `16`   |

## Comments

You can add comments to your code. Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter. They are used to explain what the code does. You can add a comment by using the `#` symbol. Everything after the `#` symbol is ignored by the Python interpreter.

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!") # This is also a comment
```

## Python Built-in Functions

Python has many built-in functions. These functions are always available, so you can use them in your programs directly. Some of the most important built-in functions are:

- `print()`: Prints the given object to the standard output device (screen) or to the text stream file.
- `input()`: Reads a line from input, converts it to a string (stripping a trailing newline), and returns that.
- `len()`: Returns the length (the number of items) of an object.
- `type()`: Returns the type of the object.
- `int()`: Returns an integer object from any number or string.
- `float()`: Returns a floating-point object from any number or string.
- `str()`: Returns a string object from any number or string.


## Lists and Tuples

To store multiple values in one variable, you can use lists and tuples. A list is a collection which is ordered and **changeable**. In Python lists are written with square brackets. You have many possibilities to work with lists. You can add, remove, or change elements. 

```python
# List
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits) # Output: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

Tuples are almost identical to lists, but written with parentheses instead of square brackets. The main difference is that tuples are **immutable**. This means that you can't change the elements of a tuple once it has been assigned. This is good for storing values that should not be changed, such as days of the week or dates on a calendar.

```python	
# Tuple
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits) # Output: ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
```

## Dictionaries

A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable, and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values. You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets.

```python
# Dictionary
person = {
  "name": "Sara",
  "language": "python",
  "country": "Germany"
}
print(person) # Output: {'name': 'Sara', 'language': 'python', 'country': 'Germany'}
```

You have many possibilities to work with dictionaries. You can add, remove, or change elements. 

```python
# Add an item to a dictionary
person["age"] = 25
print(person) # Output: {'name': 'Sara', 'language': 'python', 'country': 'Germany', 'age': 27}
 
# Remove an item from a dictionary
person.pop("age")
print(person) # Output: {'name': 'Sara', 'language': 'python', 'country': 'Germany'}

# Change an item in a dictionary
person["country"] = "USA"
print(person) # Output: {'name': 'Sara', 'language': 'python', 'country': 'USA'}

# Get the value of a specific key
print(person["name"]) # Output: Sara

# Get all keys of a dictionary
print(person.keys()) # Output: dict_keys(['name', 'language', 'country'])

# Get all values of a dictionary
print(person.values()) # Output: dict_values(['Sara', 'python', 'USA'])

# Get all items of a dictionary
print(person.items()) # Output: dict_items([('name', 'Sara'), ('language', 'python'), ('country', 'USA')])

# Check if a key exists in a dictionary
if "name" in person:
  print("Yes, 'name' is one of the keys in the person dictionary")

# Or more specific
if "name" in person.keys():
  print("Yes, 'name' is one of the keys in the person dictionary")

if "python" in person.values():
  print("Yes, 'python' is one of the values in the person dictionary")

```
