The Examination of William Hobbs At the Same Court

[H]ath this man hurt you? 

[S]everal answered yes. 

[Goo]dy Bibber said no.

[W]hat say you, are you guilty or not? 

[I] can speak in the presence of God safely, as 

[I] must look to give account another day, that I am as clear as a new born babe. 

Clear: of what? 

Of Witchcraft 

Have you never hurt these? 

No. 

Have you not consented that they should be hurt? 

Abigail Williams said, he was going to Mercy Lewes, & quickly after said Lewes was seized with a fit.

Then said Abigail cryed, he is coming to Mary Walcot , & said Mary presently fell into a fit also.

[How] can you be clear when the Children 

[saw] somthing come from you & afflict 

[th]ese persons? 

Then they fell into fits & halloo'd [and] 

[suffe]red greatly. 

[torn]ur[=Your] wife before you God wa [torn]

[torn] [conf]session: And you seen to [torn] 

[torn] before us. 

[I a]m clear of any Witch. 

[Wh]at do you call it, and over-look[ing of] 

[the]m? you look upon them & they are [hurt] 

[I h]urt none of them 

[T]hen they all fell into great fits again 

When were you at any publick Religious meeting 

Not a pretty while 

Why so? 

Because I was not well: I had a distemper that none knows. 

Can you act Witchcraft here, & by casting your eyes turn folks into fits? 

You may judge your pleasure, my soul is clear. 

Do you not see you hurt these by your look 

No. I do not know it. 

You did not answere to that question, dont you over-look them? 

No I don't over-look them. 

What do you call that way of looking upon persons, & striking them downe? 

You may judge your pleasure. 

Well but what do you call it? 

It was none of I. 

Who was it then? 

I cannot tell who they are. 

Why they say, they see you going to hurt persons & immediatly hurt persons. 

Abig: Williams said he is going to hurt Mercy Lewes [torn] & imediately s'd Mercy fell into a fit, & divers others

Can you now deny it? 

I can deny it to my dying day. 

What is the reason you go away when [there] is any reading of the Scripture in your [family] 

He denyed it. 

Nathanael Ingersol & Tho: Haynes tes[tifyed] that this Hobb's daughter had told them [so] As soon as your daughter Abigail , & aft[er] to day your wife confessed they left torturing & so would you, if you would confess: Can you still deny that you are guilty?

I am not guilty. 

If you put away Gods ordinances, no wond[er] that the Devil prevails with you. to keep his Counsell. Have you never had any apparition. 

No Sir. 

Did you never pray to the Devill that your daughter might confess no more?

No Sir. 

Who do you wo[r]ship? 

I hope I worship God only. 

Where? 

In my heart. 

But God requires outward worship [torn] 

not worship him in publick, ne [torn] 

[torn] I worship him in my heart [torn] 

[torn] worship him in your family [torn] 

[torn], speak the truth, 

[torn] not given the Devil advant[age] 

[torn] gainst you thereby? [torn] 

He was silent a considerable spa[ce] then said Yes. 

Have you not known a good while [how] that your daughter was a witc[h]

No Sir. 

Do you think she is a witch now 

I do not know. 

Well if you desire mercy from God, own the truth. 

I do not know anything of that nature. 

What do you think these people aile? 

More than ordinary? 

But what more than ordinary 

-- Silent 

Why do you not answer what do they aile? 

I do not know what they aile I am sorry 

It is none of I. 

What do you think they aile? 

There is more than ordinary 

What is that? 

I cannot tell.
